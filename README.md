# Wordmaster

[WordMaster](https://bidyutchanda.github.io/2018-11-23-wordmaster/) is an intelligent word-info provider which can do the work for you about finding anything about a word.

Input: A valid word in any language. 

Output: The program tells the meaning of the word in English or translates it to a different language, according to an user-inputted choice. All languages from ISO-639 are supported.

More details about the working of the code and also a live demo, here at my [website](https://bidyutchanda.github.io/).
